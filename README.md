# RPS

The game: Rock, Paper, Scissors.<br />
The game is done when either the player or the computer hits 5 points.

Bugs to solve:<br />
a   When computer or player hits 5 points, a message is displayed.
    This should pause the game
    an alert or something should popup
    asking: restart (create function reset)
    quit the game (create function quit - thank you message)<br />

b   Running score is only visible after the first click on a button.
    The score should visiualise 0 - 0 before clicking a button.

Improvements:<br />
1.  the UI needs to be done in CSS.
