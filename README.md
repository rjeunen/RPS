The game: Rock, Paper, Scissors.
This game will be played entirely in the console. Later (when the correct lesson comes up) a UI will be added.

This game is done for now.
You have the ability to play a game in the console consisting out of 5 rounds.
The score will be logged in the console.

** In a later lesson we will come back to this lesson and we will add a UI to this game.
