# RPS

The game: Rock, Paper, Scissors.
This game will be played entirely in the console. Later (when the correct lesson comes up) a UI will be added.

This game is done for now.
You have the ability to play a game in the console consisting out of 5 rounds.
The score will be logged in the console.

** In a later lesson we will come back to this lesson and we will add a UI to this game.

Bugs to solve:
1. When computer or player hits 5 points, a message is displayed.
    This should pause the game
    an alert or something should popup
    asking: restart (create function reset)
    quit the game (create function quit - thank you message)

Improvements:
1. the UI needs to be done in CSS.
2. winning message make-up
